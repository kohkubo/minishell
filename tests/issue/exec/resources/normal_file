       BBaasshh  is  an  sshh-compatible  command language interpreter that executes
       commands read from the standard input or from a file.  BBaasshh also incor-
       porates useful features from the _K_o_r_n and _C shells (kksshh and ccsshh).

       BBaasshh  is  intended  to  be a conformant implementation of the Shell and
       Utilities portion  of  the  IEEE  POSIX  specification  (IEEE  Standard
       1003.1).  BBaasshh can be configured to be POSIX-conformant by default.
